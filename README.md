# weather_forcast
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a weather dataset, visualizes various weather parameters, and applies multiple classification algorithms to predict weather conditions. The study uses data visualization techniques to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset, followed by the application of five different machine learning classification models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The models' effectiveness is evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting weather categories.
